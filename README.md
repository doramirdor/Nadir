## üîç **Overview**

**Nadir** is an intelligent **LLM selection framework** that dynamically chooses the best AI model for a given prompt based on:

- üöÄ **Complexity Analysis**: Evaluates text structure, difficulty, and token usage.
- ‚ö° **Multi-Provider Support**: Works with OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, and Hugging Face models.
- üí∞ **Cost & Speed Optimization**: Balances model **accuracy, response time, and pricing**.
- üîÑ **Adaptive Compression**: Reduces token usage via **truncation, keyword extraction, or AI-powered compression**.

---

## Why LLM Selection Matters

- **Tailored Performance:** The right LLM understands the nuances in your detailed prompts, delivering responses that are both precise and insightful.
- **Empowered Creativity:** When your prompts are crafted with depth, the LLM becomes an extension of your vision, helping you explore ideas and solve problems innovatively.
- **Maximized Impact:** Strategic LLM selection ensures that every dollar spent translates into greater creative output and operational efficiency.

## Prompt Complexity: The Key to Unlocking Brilliance

- **Guiding Detail:** Complex prompts provide rich context and clear instructions, steering the LLM towards high-quality, context-aware responses.
- **Enhanced Innovation:** Detailed prompts allow the LLM to process multi-step reasoning and intricate logic, unlocking layers of creativity that simple prompts might miss.
- **Precision and Insight:** When you invest in crafting thoughtful, detailed prompts, you set the stage for the LLM to deliver outputs that elevate your work to the next level.

## Balancing Complexity and Cost

- **Invest Wisely:** Advanced LLMs excel with complex prompts but come at a higher cost. The key is to find the right balance that meets your needs without overspending.
- **Optimize Your Approach:** Start with simple prompts to gauge performance, then gradually introduce more complexity as needed. This iterative approach ensures you get the best value for your investment.
- **Maximize ROI:** By aligning the depth of your prompts with the appropriate LLM, you achieve optimal efficiency‚Äîharnessing the full power of AI while managing expenses effectively.

## Installation

Install Nadir using pip:

```bash
pip install nadir-llm
```

---

## Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env file to store your API keys:

```
# .env file
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_google_ai_key
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=your_huggingface_api_key

```

## üöÄ Usage

### üîπ Select the Best LLM for a Prompt

```python
from src.nadir.llm_selector.selector.auto import AutoSelector

nadir = AutoSelector()
prompt = "Explain quantum entanglement in simple terms."
response = nadir.generate_response(prompt)

print(response)
```

### üîπ Get Complexity Analysis & Recommended Model

```python
complexity_details = nadir.get_complexity_details("What is the speed of light in vacuum?")
print(complexity_details)
```

### üîπ List Available Models

```python
models = nadir.list_available_models()
print(models)
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Usage: Using LLMComplexityAnalyzer and Compression

### üîπ Analyzing Code Complexity and Selecting the Best LLM

```python
from src.nadir.complexity.llm import LLMComplexityAnalyzer
from src.nadir.llm_selector.selector.auto import AutoSelector

# Initialize the LLM-based complexity analyzer
complexity_analyzer = LLMComplexityAnalyzer()

# Sample Python code
code_snippet = """
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        return n * factorial(n-1)
"""

# Get detailed complexity metrics
complexity_details = complexity_analyzer.get_complexity_details(code_snippet)
print("Complexity Details:", complexity_details)

# Initialize Nadir and dynamically select the best model
nadir = AutoSelector(complexity_analyzer=complexity_analyzer)
selected_model = nadir.select_model(code_snippet)
print("Selected Model:", selected_model.name)


```

### üîπ Compressing Long Prompts Before Model Selection

```python
from src.nadir.compression import GeminiCompressor
from src.nadir.llm_selector.selector.auto import AutoSelector

# Initialize Gemini-based prompt compression
compressor = GeminiCompressor()

# A very long prompt
long_prompt = """
Machine learning models require extensive preprocessing and feature engineering.
However, feature selection techniques vary widely based on the type of data.
For example, in text-based datasets, TF-IDF, word embeddings, and transformers
play a significant role, whereas in tabular data, methods like PCA, correlation
analysis, and decision tree-based feature selection are preferred.
"""

# Compress the prompt
compressed_prompt = compressor.compress(long_prompt, method="auto", max_tokens=100)
print("Compressed Prompt:", compressed_prompt)

# Use Nadir to select the best model for the compressed prompt
nadir = AutoSelector()
selected_model = nadir.select_model(compressed_prompt)
print("Selected Model:", selected_model.name)
```

### üîπ Combining Compression & Complexity Analysis

```python
from src.nadir.compression import GeminiCompressor
from src.nadir.complexity.llm import LLMComplexityAnalyzer
from src.nadir.llm_selector.selector.auto import AutoSelector

# Initialize complexity analyzer and compressor
complexity_analyzer = LLMComplexityAnalyzer()
compressor = GeminiCompressor()

# A long, complex prompt
long_prompt = """
Deep learning models often suffer from overfitting when trained on small datasets.
To combat this, techniques such as dropout, batch normalization, and L2 regularization
are widely used. Furthermore, transfer learning from pre-trained models has become
a popular method for reducing the need for large labeled datasets.
"""

# Step 1: Compress the prompt
compressed_prompt = compressor.compress(long_prompt, method="auto", max_tokens=80)
print("Compressed Prompt:", compressed_prompt)

# Step 2: Analyze complexity
complexity_details = complexity_analyzer.get_complexity_details(compressed_prompt)
print("Complexity Details:", complexity_details)

# Step 3: Select the best model
nadir = AutoSelector(complexity_analyzer=complexity_analyzer)
selected_model = nadir.select_model(compressed_prompt, complexity_details)
print("Selected Model:", selected_model.name)

```

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Complexity Analysis

Uses `LLMComplexityAnalyzer` to evaluate **token usage**, **linguistic difficulty**, and **structural complexity**.
Assigns a **complexity score** (0-100).

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Intelligent Model Selection

Compares **complexity scor**e with **pre-configured LLM models**.
Chooses **the best trade-off between cost, accuracy, and speed**.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Efficient Response Generation

**Compresses long prompts** when necessary.
Calls **the selected model** and **tracks token usage & cost**.
