    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Project Description:**  \n",
    "Develop a **Retro Basketball Scoreboard App** that immerses users in the classic vibe of old-school basketball scoreboards while providing robust functionality for real-time game tracking. The app will allow users to manage scores, fouls, timers, and player information, including substitutions, personal fouls, and individual performance metrics. A registration system for teams and players will enhance pre-game preparation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The app will be highly interactive, featuring a nostalgic retro design with analog-inspired elements and engaging animations. All data will be managed locally in the browser without external database dependencies.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Features to Include:**  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **1. Team and Player Registration**  \n",

    "  - Initial foul and score count set to 0.  \n",
    "- Display team rosters with all registered players before starting the game.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **2. Editable Team and Player Information**  \n",
    "- Allow users to edit:  \n",
    "  - **Team names**  \n",
    "  - **Player information** (e.g., name, jersey number).  \n",
    "- Real-time updates to reflect changes in the scoreboard interface.  \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### **4. Foul Tracking**  \n",
    "- Track fouls at both **team** and **individual player** levels:  \n",
    "  - **Add Foul Button** for each player, updating personal and team fouls.  \n",
    "  - Notify users when a player accumulates **5 personal fouls**, suggesting substitution.  \n",
    "  - Highlight team fouls when they reach **5 total fouls**, with a retro buzzer effect.  \n",
    "- Visual indicators (e.g., flashing red for players at foul limits).  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **5. Player Substitution**  \n",
    "- Allow users to substitute players:  \n",
    "  - Replace a fouled-out player with another registered player.  \n",

    "#### **7. Shot Clock**  \n",
    "- Include a **24-second shot clock**:  \n",
    "  - Resettable via a button with automatic reset after each scoring play.  \n",
    "  - Buzzer and visual indicator when the shot clock expires.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **8. Dynamic Team and Game Stats Display**  \n",

    "\n",
    "#### **10. Offline Data Management**  \n",
    "- All game data stored locally in the browser using Web Storage (e.g., `localStorage`):  \n",
    "  - Persist data for team rosters, scores, and fouls until manually reset.  \n",

    "- **Shot Clock Placement:** Prominently displayed near the timer for quick visibility.  \n",
    "- **Buttons:** Large, tactile buttons for scoring and fouling, styled like physical controls.  \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Responsive Design:**  \n",
    "- Scales across devices:  \n",
